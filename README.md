### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

We have built an inspirational poster generator. It allows the user to either generate a random inspirational poster, or to design their own. The user can add their own image, title for the poster, and inspirational quote, which they can save or delete. The data provided by the user is saved individually into the arrays storing the pictures, the titles, and the quotes,
will be returned in the random poster generator provided at a later time.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

1. fork this repository
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. cd into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor

To view our project:

1. In your terminal, navigate to your project repo
2. Run the command `open index.html`
3. try it out! git inspired.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

We chose this screenshot because its the poster we created hundreds of times as we tested our webpage.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

We spent a total of 27 hrs on this project. I would guess that 4 hrs was spent just understanding the project and how to approach it, 5 hrs was spent trying to get are (git workflow) functioning, and the remaining time was spent actually coding and problem solving.

This is mod 1, week two for both my partner and myself.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

I feel like there were a lot of learning goals in this project
Broadly speaking our first goal was simply to understand the manipulation of the DOM, but there are a lot of components to that.
- Understanding nodes
- Understanding Event Listeners, query Selectors
- Interacting with HTML and CSS
- self teaching / googling

Another big learning goal was understanding and utilizing proper git workflow
- Connecting repositories
- Creating and working in branches
- Writing better commits
- Reviewing pull requests
- correctly pulling into working branches and main

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them

Win 1.	our first win was realizing that we accidentally completed iteration 2 at the same time we did iteration one, this was by mistake. we know that this wont always be a win, but after spending 9hrs on iteration 1 it felt like a win.

Win 2.	We were always really close on problems. Any time we got stuck and had someone look at our issue, the solution was always something small. It was a great confidence boost to know that we were working through the problem ourselves, knowing that we understood the logic we were implementing.

Challenge 1.	We could have done a better job with our naming conventions, but it was the first real project we have done so there was a lot of learning as we progressed throughout the project. on our next project we talked about reading ahead and planning out how we want to name everything, taking into account the full scope of the project before we decide on are naming convention	 

Challenge 2.	Making our functions more global, near the end we understood that we could have designed are functions to be more global. In the end I think we did quite well and i'm very proud of the code we wrote.
